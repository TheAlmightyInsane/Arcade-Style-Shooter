This is my take on a arcade style shooter, all assets used in this game were found on either devian art or http://opengameart.org/.
I will admit that the base of this game is from a tutorial that I was following by since that I have done multiple customizations
to the code that makes it my own.

Instructions on how to play this game!

1. Drag the ScrollingShooter.love file and drag it onto the love - shortcut.

2. Play the game you make push escape anytime to close the game or press the x button on the top right corner.

Sidenotes:

Everything inside the LOVE folder is the game engine's code that runs the game. (I do not own any of the files in there.)

Ignore the cosole that pops up with the game that will be removed later when the game is at a more stable state.
